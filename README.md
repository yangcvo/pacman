Jacman based on the Pacman theme to modify, there are many different features and the original theme. You can go to the site and Demo preview more about this topic for more results. If you have any questions or comments welcome to issue GitHub.
From the beginning I have Jacman open source has been half a year zero or one weeks, and in the six months has been maintained on the Jacman update. See a lot of people with this theme, fork&star number is also getting better and better, I also have more power to continue to improve Jacman. Jacman naturally there are a lot of space to improve, the first document is a problem, there are many people through the blog, micro-blog, QQ asked me about the subject of the problem, I also realized that the help manual to write before the readability is too poor. Just taking advantage of the Jacman big update, write a more detailed, readable manual.
